    "whoWeAreText": "Arukah is a Hebrew word which means healing and restoration. Arukah Global Foundation (AGF) is a faith based tax exempt organization which came about as a result wanting to see the people of Cameroon have access to basic health care services. While communicable diseases such as HIV and Malaria have been the focus of most health campaigns in Africa, a growing middle class population has also led to an increase in non-communicable diseases such as Diabetes, hypertension, heart diseases and strokes. Lack of medical equipment, financial resources, hospital infrastructure, trained medical personnel, and financial resources are the main factors which contribute to the lagging health system.",
